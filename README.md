# ts-project-template
A template repository for any Typescript project I start

Things to keep in mind:
- This is frontend/backend agnostic. Types/ESlint plugins etc. may need to be added depending on the project
- The packages in this repo may get outdated, so `yarn upgrade` may be needed (hopefully going to set up auto-updating for this)
